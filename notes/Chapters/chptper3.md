# Chapter 3: Variables and Constants in C++

## **Variables**

### **Definition**:
A **variable** is a storage location that holds a value and can be modified during the program's execution.

### **Declaration**:
A variable must be declared with a specific data type.

### **Modification**:
The value of a variable can be changed during the program's execution.

**Example**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int age = 25;  // Variable declaration
    age = 30;      // Variable can be modified
    cout << "Age: " << age << endl;  // Output will be 30
    return 0;
}
```

## **Constants**

### **Definition**:
A **constant** is a value that cannot be modified once it is assigned. Constants are often used to represent fixed values throughout the program.

### **Declaration**:
A constant is declared using the `const` keyword.

### **Modification**:
The value of a constant cannot be changed after initialization.

**Example**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    const int MAX_AGE = 100;  // Constant declaration
    // MAX_AGE = 120;  // This will cause a compile-time error
    cout << "Max Age: " << MAX_AGE << endl;  // Output will be 100
    return 0;
}
```

## **Key Differences**

- **Variables**: Can be modified during the program’s execution.
- **Constants**: Cannot be modified after initialization.

# **Comments in Code and How to Comment in C++**

In C++, **comments** are used to explain code and are ignored by the compiler.

### **Types of Comments**:

1. **Single-Line Comment**:
   - Begins with `//` and comments out a single line.
   ```cpp
   // This is a single-line comment
   ```

2. **Multi-Line Comment**:
   - Begins with `/*` and ends with `*/`, used for multi-line comments.
   ```cpp
   /* This is a 
      multi-line comment */
   ```

### **Example**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int age = 25;  // Store the age
    cout << "Age: " << age << endl;  // Output the age
    return 0;
}
```

### **Key Points**:
- Use comments to explain **why** something is done.
- Don’t over-comment simple or obvious code.

## **Why Do We Need Variables?**

We need **variables** in programming to **store**, **process**, and **display data** dynamically. Here's why:

### 1. **Store Data**:
   - Variables hold data (like numbers or text) for future use.
   ```cpp
   int age = 25;  // 'age' stores the value 25
   ```

### 2. **Process Data**:
   - Variables allow us to perform calculations or modify data.
   ```cpp
   int sum = a + b;  // 'sum' stores the result of a + b
   ```

### 3. **Display Output**:
   - Variables help display results to the user.
   ```cpp
   cout << "The result is: " << sum << endl;  // Displays 'sum'
   ```

### 4. **Flexibility**:
   - Variables allow programs to work with **changing data** like user input.
   ```cpp
   int age;
   cin >> age;  // User enters their age
   ```

### **Conclusion**:
Variables are essential to **store**, **process**, and **display data**, making programs flexible and interactive.

## **Difference Between Variable Initialization and Declaration**

### **Variable Declaration**:
When you declare a variable, you specify its **type** (like `int`, `float`, etc.), but you don’t give it a value yet.

**Example**:
```cpp
int age;  // Declaration (just declaring the variable 'age' with no value)
```

### **Variable Initialization**:
When you declare a variable and give it an **initial value** at the same time.

**Example**:
```cpp
int age = 25;  // Declaration + Initialization (declaring 'age' and setting its value to 25)
```

### **Key Difference**:
- **Declaration**: Declaring a variable without setting a value.
- **Initialization**: Declaring a variable and assigning an initial value.

## **What Are Identifiers in Programming?**

### **Definition**:
**Identifiers** are names used to identify variables, functions, classes, or any other user-defined elements in a program.

### **Key Points**:
1. **Examples**: `age`, `totalAmount`, `sum()`, `StudentClass`
2. **Rules**:
   - Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
   - Can contain letters, digits (0-9), and underscores.
   - Cannot start with a digit.
   - Cannot be a keyword (like `int`, `for`, `if`, etc.).
3. **Case-Sensitive**: Identifiers are case-sensitive, meaning `Age` and `age` are different.

### **Example**:
```cpp
int age = 25;  // 'age' is an identifier
float totalAmount = 100.50;  // 'totalAmount' is an identifier
```

### **Conclusion**:
Identifiers are used to **name** and refer to elements in your program.

## **How to Make a Constant Variable in C++**

### **Definition**:
Use the `const` keyword to make a constant variable. The value of a constant cannot be changed after it’s initialized.

### **Syntax**:
```cpp
const data_type variable_name = value;
```

### **Example**:
```cpp
const int MAX_AGE = 100;  // Constant variable with value 100
```

Once set, its value **cannot** be changed.
